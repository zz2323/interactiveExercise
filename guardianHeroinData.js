Sometimes I think I am pretty normal until something like this happens. It keeps me scared straight. I double up on meetings. Pray, work my steps and work with my sponsees. I am one drink or drug away from a relapse ... A living hell if not death. Do I have another high in me? Yes. Do I have another clean and sobering up? I don\'t know. ",

Hearing and reading about it in the news doesn\'t make me want to stay clean but it creates these urges to use again. I'm not sure if It\'s because as an addict I have a self destructive persona or because I miss that dark abyss. All I know is that hearing about these high profile over doses doesn\'t make me thankful to be clean but it brings out the curiosity within me. What if that was me? What if?",
